# Android

Before you continue, please make sure you have installed and initialized [Capacitor](../0intro) in Bionic and that [Android Studio](../0intro/#android-studio) is installed.

## Initialize Capacitor Android

This step is only required once and it will generate the necessary assets under ```platform/capacitor/android``` directory.

```text
> bionic platform capacitor android init
...
ðŸš€  Capacitor Android is ready to go! - try: bionic platform capacitor android open
```

## Build and deploy Capacitor Android

This step prepares Blazor assets for Capacitor Android deployment.

```text
> bionic platform capacitor android build
â˜•  Building Android Capacitor...
âœ” Copying web assets from www to android/app/src/main/assets/public in 42.83ms
âœ” Copying native bridge in 6.31ms
âœ” Copying capacitor.config.json in 1.55ms
âœ” copy in 58.91ms
ðŸš€  Capacitor successfully built. Try: bionic platform capacitor android open
```

This step opens Android Studio with the project ready to go:

```text
> bionic platform capacitor android open
â˜•  Opening Android Capacitor project...
[info] Opening Android project at ./platforms/capacitor/android
```

Run the App in Emulator:

Select Virtual Device. Make sure it has a recent Android API since WebAssembly is only available in recent APIs:

And if everything went well, the app should be loaded in the provided device or emulator.

Please remember that Capacitor is still in Beta and you may encounter some minor issues.
