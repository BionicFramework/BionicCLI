# Getting Started

The Bionic Capacitor Bridge provides access to the device APIs through Capacitor. If you don't need any of the provided functionality, then you can just skip it.

You can read more about Capacitor APIs [here](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/apis/).

## Initialize Capacitor Bridge

This step is only required once per project.
