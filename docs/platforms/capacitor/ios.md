Before you continue, please make sure you have installed and initialized [Capacitor](../0intro) in Bionic and that [Apple's XCode](../0intro/#ios) is installed.

## Initialize Capacitor iOS

This step is only required once and it will generate the necessary assets under ```platform/capacitor/ios``` directory.

```text
> bionic platform capacitor ios init
...
ðŸš€  Capacitor iOS is ready to go! - try: bionic platform capacitor ios open
```

## Build and deploy Capacitor iOS

This step prepares Blazor assets for Capacitor iOS deployment.

```text
