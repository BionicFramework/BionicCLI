# Electron

[Electron](https://electronjs.org/) allows for the development of desktop GUI applications using front and back end components originally developed for web applications.
The Bionic platform plugin uses a direct template provided by Electron and wraps it up for convenient development.

!!! info
    Bionic will eventually provide another way of deploying Electron apps through Bionic Capacitor Plugin.

## Requirements

### NodeJS

Capacitor depends on NodeJS. Please [install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or ensure that you are using a current NodeJS version:

```text
> node --version
v9.5.0
```

## Prepare your Blazor app for Electron

### Ensure that index.html is explicitly defined

Electron will fail to route to index.html if page is not explicitly defined. To fix this issue find your ```index.cshtml``` page and, if not present, add ```@page "/index.html"```.
The Blazor Standalone template ```Pages/index.cshtml``` should look this in order to make it work with Electron:

```html
@page "/"
@page "/index.html"

<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

Welcome to your new app.

<SurveyPrompt Title="How is Blazor working for you?" />
```

### Ensure that the document base URL is set to look into the current directory

Edit ```wwwroot/index.html``` and change ```<base href="/" />``` to be ```<base href="./" />```.

## Initializing Electron

First, we need to download and install Bionic's Electron Plugin. This step is only required once per project. From your project (or Blazor Client) directory do:

```text
> bionic platform add electron
🔍  Looking for electron platform plugin
☕  Found it! Adding electron plugin...
🚀  electron platform successfully added
```

This will create the necessary assets under ```platforms/electron```.

The next step is to initialize Electron, and similarly, you only need to execute this step once:

```text
> bionic platform electron init
☕  Initializing Electron...
...
🚀  Electron is ready to go! - try: bionic platform electron serve
```

## Building and Serving Electron

The following steps are to be executed everytime you want to deploy the latest changes in Electron.

First, rebuild your Blazor/Bionic project to ensure compiled assets are up-to-date:
```text
> dotnet build
```

Then prepare all assets in Electron platform directory:

```text
> bionic platform electron build
☕  Building Electron...
🚀  Electron successfully built. Try: bionic platform electron serve
```

Finally serve Electron:

```text
> bionic platform electron serve
☕  Serving Electron...
```
